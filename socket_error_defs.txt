broken pipe
----------- 
This error usually means that, the client, after waiting for a specific time, 
closes the socket connection that was created with the server. But the server 
doesn't know that and it continues to fetch data from the data source. It will
come to know that the client has closed the connection only when it tries to
send the data to the client through the socket connection that was created
earlier. Hence, you can find this error "IO error: Broken pipe" in the server logs.


connection reset by peer
------------------------
"Connection reset by peer" is the TCP/IP equivalent of slamming the phone back
on the hook. It's more polite than merely not replying, leaving one hanging.
But it's not the FIN-ACK expected of the truly polite TCP/IP converseur. 

bad file descriptor
-------------------
In general, when "Bad File Descriptor" is encountered, it means that the socket
file descriptor you passed into the API is not valid, which has multiple possible
reasons:
    The fd is already closed somewhere.
    The fd has a wrong value, which is inconsistent with the value obtained 
    from socket() api
